\title{Score test for effect in the cumulative probit model}
\usage{
Score_test_for_effect_in_the_probit_model_2xc(
  n,
  alphahat0,
  printresults = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{the observed counts (a 2xc matrix)}

\item{alphahat0}{a column vector with c-1 estimated coefficients
(\code{alpha_j}) under the null hypothesis (\code{beta = 0})}

\item{printresults}{display results (F = no, T = yes)}
}
\description{
The score test for effect in the cumulative probit model
described in Chapter 6 "The Ordered 2xc Table"
}
\note{
Must give the alphahats under the null hypothesis as input,
because Matlab does not calculate an intercept-only probit model (and this
may apply to R code as well). alphahat0 can be calculated in, for instance,
Stata.
