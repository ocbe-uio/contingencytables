\title{The Chacko test for order-restriction}
\usage{
Chacko_test_1xc(n)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{the observed counts (a 1xc vector, where c is the number of categories)}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the two-sided p-value, the statistic and the
degrees of freedom.
}
\description{
Described in Chapter 3, "The 1xc Table and the Multinomial
Distribution", Chacko (1966) derived a test based on the Pearson chi-square
statistic to test the hypothesis that the categories of a multinomial
variable with \code{c} possible outcomes have a natural ordering. The test
statistic is asymptotically chi-squared distributed.
