\title{The Wald CI  with CC for the binomial probability}
\usage{
Wald_CI_CC_1x2(X, n, alpha = 0.05, printresults = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{the number of successes}

\item{n}{the total number of observations}

\item{alpha}{the nominal level, e.g. 0.05 for 95# CIs}

\item{printresults}{display results (0 = no, 1 = yes)}
}
\value{
A vector containing lower, upper and point estimates of the statistic
}
\description{
The Wald confidence interval with continuity correction for the
binomial probability. Described in Chapter 2 "The 1x2 Table and the Binomial
Distribution"
}
