\description{
Duration of symptoms and tumor stage for patients treated for
colorectal cancer (Jullumstrø et al., 2009).

Early detection and treatment of colorectal cancer is beneficial, because
advanced stages of colorectal cancer have poorer prognosis. Table 7.7
displays duration of symptoms (rows) versus tumor stage (columns) in a study
of 784 patients treated for colorectal cancer at a regional hospital in
Norway from 1980 to 2004 (Jullumstrø et al., 2009). The rows as well as the
columns are ordered, and Table 7.7 can be regarded as a doubly ordered 4 × 4
table.
