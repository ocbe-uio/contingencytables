\title{The score test with continuity correction for the}
\usage{
Score_test_CC_1x2(X, n, pi0)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{the number of successes}

\item{n}{the total number of observations}

\item{pi0}{a given probability}
}
\value{
A vector containing the two-sided p-value and the score test statistic
}
\description{
The score test with continuity correction for the
binomial probability (pi).
H_0: pi = pi0  vs  H_A: pi ~= pi0 (two-sided).
Described in Chapter 2 "The 1x2 Table and the Binomial Distribution"
