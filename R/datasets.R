#' Low Birth Weight vs psychiatric morbitidy with control as reference category

#'
#' Lund et al. (2012) report psychiatric morbidity in young adulthood in two low
#' birth weight groups and a control group. The subjects were born between 1986
#' and 1988. The very low birth weight (VLBW) group consisted of babies born
#' preterm with birth weight ≤ 1500 grams. The small for gestational age at
#' term (SGA) group was born at term with birth weight below the 10th percentile
#' adjusted for gestational age, sex, and parity. The control group was born at
#' term, and was not small for gestational age. Table 7.6 shows the severity
#' level of psychiatric problems at age 20 years. We shall regard the birth
#' groups as unordered; however, the diagnostic groups are naturally ordered.
#' Hence, Table 7.6 is a singly ordered 3 × 3 table with unordered rows and

#'
#' In the HUNT study (Nord-Trøndelag county health survey), one of the questions
#' is: “How is your overall health at the moment?” The outcome categories
#' are “Very good”, “Good”, “Not very good”, and “Poor”. Table 7.9 shows

#' (Young-HUNT 1), and for the same individuals four years later (Young-HUNT 2;
#' Breidablik et al. (2008)). Both the rows and the columns are ordered. In
#' this example, it may be appropriate to regard self-rated health as an
#' unobserved (latent) continuous variable, where only a categorized version has
#' been observed. Table 7.9 is actually an example of a paired c × c table with
